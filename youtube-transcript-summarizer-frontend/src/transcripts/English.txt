Today i want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories [music] the first story is about connecting the dots i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before i really quit so why'd i drop out it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers that a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and 17 years later i did go to college Dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards 10 years later again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference [music] my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life was and i started apple in my parents garage when i was 20. And so i decided to start over i didn't see it then it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next .
